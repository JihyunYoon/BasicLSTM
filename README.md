# Basic Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

* Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of deep learning model that is mostly used for analysis of sequential data (time series data prediction). 
* There are different application areas that are used: Language model, neural machine translation, music generation, time series prediction, financial prediction, etc. 
* The aim of this implementation is to help to learn structure of basic LSTM (LSTM cell forward, LSTM cell backward, etc..).
* Code is adapted from Andrew Ng's Course 'Sequential models'.
